title: Long Hiatus Explained
---

Hello world!

I don't know why I feel the need to write this. I don't really need to explain it to anyone but let this post serve the purpose of explaining why there is or there would be gaps in me writing posts. It's been almost a year since I last wrote, but then what can I say? 

I had work. I got busy. But I don't regret anything I've done in this big gap I took. I did a lot of different things and had fun with it. Again, I'm not sure why I'm writing this but I feel like once I do put this up, I can get back to the habit of writing posts. It's not going to be a blog where I write things in great English, or writing as if my 'beloved fans' are waiting :p I doubt if there exist these 'beloved fans' in the first place, but I write for myself. I would like to share things and whoever is up for it can read.

I'm back, blog. I continue my journey. It never stopped in the first place anyway.

If anyone is really waiting for me to write on things, I'd like to let you know that I do have lots of drafts on my notes that I just can't seem to finish for some reason. But this hiatus wasn't a waste. I have a lot of opinions I'd like to share and a lot of topics on my notes and I want to clear my notes ASAP.

Something's coming soon for sure. Take this as another relationship I guess, this also requires patience.
