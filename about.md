Greetings, fellow reader.

My name is Vineet Jiji Cherian.

I am very bad at giving a quick introduction. I don't give an automated response of the form "(insert name), (insert place)" when asked for an introduction. I don't know if I associate myself with any place at all, or if I do with every place I was at.

I was born in Ranni, Kerala, on November 19, 1998. Soon enough, I moved to Haldia, West Bengal. In a couple of years, I moved to Panipat, Haryana. I spent 5 years there, and within that much time, I mastered Hindi and lost most of my fluency in Malayalam. Somewhere in the middle of 2007, I moved to Qatar, and my parents, my younger sister and I reside there ever since.
Currently, I am a B.Tech final-year student studying Computer Science at National Institute of Technology, Calicut, India.

There, I don't have to repeat it anymore. Just read this whenever you want :p

Other than 'a floating could of ideas, jack of all trades and a thinker', I'm also a sceptic about pretty much everything in life. I question everything as I see it. I know I've annoyed most of my teachers by asking a lot of questions. Only some teachers found it as a good sign of learning, and they helped in making me who I am today. I am an agnostic person when it comes to religion. I question the existence of a super being. I question policies, laws and social and cultural constructs. I love learning about anything and everything. I don't know if I'll get to learn about everything there is to learn about, but I know I'm doing well by questioning things. My curiosity fuels me to learn new things and develop my views on various subjects. Most of all, I seek positive change.

This pretty much sums up what I'm doing in life, and what I'd love to tell people: Be curious. Seek knowledge. Question everything. Embrace change.

It's a very vague introduction, so I might keep changing this whenever I like.

Till then, if you seem even a little interested, read away. This will have everything that I am interested and passionate about, things I like doing, things that I might take up later on, and things I think of and feel deeply about.

I present to you, the musings and doings of a sceptic, starting with the adventures as a new-born 'blogger'.

Henceforth, I shall write.
